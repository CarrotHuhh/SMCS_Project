Our GRASP implementation follows the two-phase iterative framework proposed by Feo and Resende (1989) to address the set covering nature of driver scheduling. In the construction phase, rather than a purely greedy selection, a Restricted Candidate List (RCL) is formed containing valid duties whose trip coverage is within a threshold α of the best available option. A duty is then randomly sampled from this list, a probabilistic mechanism that enables the algorithm to explore diverse solution spaces and escape local optima common in driver shortage scenarios. Each constructed solution undergoes a local search refinement to eliminate redundant duties, ensuring that the limited workforce is utilized with maximum efficiency. By repeating this process over N iterations and retaining the best result, GRASP provides a robust and computationally efficient alternative to ILP for real-time service recovery.
